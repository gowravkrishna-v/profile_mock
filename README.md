# Profile Mock

This project consists of a profile page that displays user details, user posts, and albums from [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). The app uses BLoC state management and Isar as a local database for offline handling.

NOTE: While running iOS simulator, the default pictures that are present in the gallery may be corrupted. So try downloading an image using Safari and use the same while testing image picker from gallery.
